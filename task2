Explain the difference between Absolute and Relative positioning.

Ans:Absolute and relative positioning are two common concepts in web development and graphic design that describe how elements on a webpage or in a layout are positioned in relation to their parent or other elements. Let's break down the differences between them:
 
Absolute Positioning:

Absolute positioning allows you to specify the exact position of an element relative to a positioned ancestor or the entire web page.
When an element is absolutely positioned, it is taken out of the normal document flow, which means it won't affect the positioning of other elements.
You can use properties like top, right, bottom, and left to specify the distance between the element and its nearest positioned ancestor or the page itself.
Absolute positioning is often used for creating overlays, pop-up windows, or placing elements precisely in a specific location on a page.

Relative Positioning:

Relative positioning allows you to position an element relative to its normal position in the document flow or relative to its nearest positioned ancestor.
When an element is relatively positioned, it still occupies space in the document flow, and other elements are positioned as if it were in its original position.
You can use properties like top, right, bottom, and left to adjust the element's position relative to where it would normally be placed.
Relative positioning is often used to make minor adjustments to the position of elements without disrupting the layout significantly.
